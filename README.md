# SAE Autonomous Simulation

From 
`C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\programming\remoteApiBindings\python\python` you'll 
need to copy over the sim.py, and simConst.py files into your working directory. Then copy over the library from 
`C:\Program Files\CoppeliaRobotics\CoppeliaSimEdu\programming\remoteApiBindings\lib\lib\` (`lib\Windows\remoteApi.dll`
if you are on windows). Then start the simulation in Coppelia Sim from scene.ttt, and run
test.py to connect to the scene.
